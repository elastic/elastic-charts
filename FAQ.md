# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are our responses to questions we expect to get frequently.

## What is the Elastic Charts?

The Elastic Charts is a library in use at Elastic to build visualizations that need to share our branding and look and feel. It distributes a set of charts for use in building web data visualizations.

## Can I use Elastic Charts?

The Elastic Charts is intended to only be used on Elastic products and is not supported as a discrete, independent charting library. We do not recommend using it unless you are working on Elastic products or plugins to those products.

## Why is Elastic Charts open source?

Many of our products themselves are open source and rely upon this library to function. It exists as an independent library so that chart patterns can be shared across teams and design standards can be scaled across our organization. Since most of our products are open source, we treat this one similarly as far as public publishing and conversation even if its usage tends to focus more inward towards Elastic itself.

## What about reporting bugs and feature requests?

Bug reports are most welcome, but we're not considering external feature requests at this time.
