// Z-Index

// Remember that z-index is relative to parent and based on the stacking context.
// z-indexs only compete against other z-indexs when they exist as children of
// that shared parent.

// That means a popover with a settings of 2, will still show above a modal
// with a setting of 100, if it is within that modal and not besides it.

// Generaly that means it's a good idea to consider things added to this file
// as competitive only as siblings.
